# Documentation 

Documentation is [available online](https://jv-conseil-internet-consulting.github.io/dkim-php-mail-signature/classes/JVconseil.DkimPhpMailSignature.DKIMconfig.html), though it may not be quite up to date or match your version exactly.

You can generate API documentation by running `phpdoc` in the top-level folder of this project, and documentation will be generated in this folder:
```
php ~/vendor/bin/phpdoc -d ~/dkim-php-mail-signature/ -t ~/dkim-php-mail-signature/docs/
```

You will need to have [phpDocumentor](https://www.phpdoc.org) installed, though you will already have that if you installed PHPMailer using composer with dev modules enabled.
